# Twitter Project

Repo for how things are working with the Twitter Research Project done with CURENT. 


# Getting the Repo
All you need to do is either clone it with Git or if you don't know Git, just download the zip file containing it all.

# Getting Tweets
In the #GetProg# Folder, you'll be using Exporter.py to handle the gathering of Tweets. 
This takes a bit of time so be patentient with it all. 

It operates under several modes but the two main ones are "--username" and "--querysearch".
For most purposes, "--querysearch" is all that's needed unless you want to focus on a certain person. 

Using Unix with Python installed. Once in the directory, open a terminal and input

**python Exporter.py --COMMAND "USERNAME"**

This will gather and store all the tweets doing this. Several instances of this program can be run at the same time.
